## I) Next Steps for Production

### Immediate (Before First Deploy)
1. ⚠️ Configure Loudly API key in environment
2. ⚠️ Configure Beatoven API key in environment
3. ⚠️ Configure S3 storage credentials
4. ⚠️ Configure Stripe publishable key
5. ⚠️ Set up Netlify or Vercel deployment
6. ⚠️ Configure environment variables in hosting platform

### Backend (Required for Live Generation)
1. Implement Netlify/Vercel serverless functions:
   - `POST /api/generate` - Create track and enqueue job
   - `GET /api/status?id=` - Poll track status
   - `POST /api/purchase` - Handle credit purchase and full render
   - `GET /api/download?id=&asset=` - Serve signed URLs
2. Set up background worker for provider API calls
3. Implement S3 upload for preview/full assets
4. Add Stripe payment processing

### Wave 2 Features (Future)
- Eleven Music integration when API access granted
- Stems editor and mix controls
- Batch generation
- User authentication (currently using Supabase auth primitives)
- Admin dashboard
- Usage analytics
