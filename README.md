## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests

```bash
npx tsx src/lib/test-runner.ts
```

### Manual Test Prompts

**Valid Jingle:**
```json
{
  "type": "JINGLE",
  "brief": {
    "genre": "Country",
    "mood": "upbeat",
    "durationSec": 30,
    "vocals": "NONE"
  }
}
```

**Blocked Prompt:**
```json
{
  "type": "INSTRUMENTAL",
  "brief": {
    "genre": "Pop",
    "mood": "in the style of Taylor Swift",
    "durationSec": 30,
    "vocals": "NONE"
  }
}
```
Expected: "Artist-style prompts are not allowed"
